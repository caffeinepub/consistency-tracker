  "summary": "Diff adds a Steady Climb plan lookup (month 1–12) and updates Monthly Targets panel logic to compute a monthly “Total” from records while also looking up a month-mapped plan “Target” for press-ups/push-ups, squats, and plank (with duration formatting for time units). MonthTabs was adjusted to reliably map calendar months to numeric 1–12 via clamped parsing.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "For each applicable habit row, the UI displays both (a) completed monthly total computed from records and (b) the Steady Climb plan target for the selected month (e.g., show both 'Total' and 'Target').",
      "reason": "MonthlyTargetsEditor adds helpers for display total/target and changes layout to a 3-column grid, but the diff is truncated before the row content is shown, so it’s not verifiable from provided evidence that both values are actually rendered and clearly presented as separate Total vs Target fields/labels for each habit row.",
