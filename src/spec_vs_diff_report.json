  "summary": "Implemented mandatory Internet Identity gating at the app entry (LoginScreen shown when unauthenticated), added React Query retry/backoff defaults, and introduced a silent bounded background retry hook for actor initialization. Dashboard rendering was adjusted to avoid a blocking connection/error banner and to use non-blocking loading states. However, the diff evidence only clearly shows automatic loading for profile/habits/monthly records; it does not explicitly show post-login auto-loading for diary and investments data.",

      "requirement": "After sign-in, load the user’s previously stored data (profile, habits, records, diary, investments) tied to their Internet Identity principal.",
      "reason": "The diff shows authenticated data loading for user profile, habits, and monthly records, but does not provide evidence that diary and investments data are fetched/loaded automatically after login (relevant hooks and queries are not shown in the provided diff summary).",
